Welcome to My Repository!

Introduction:
This Repo is all about 'Extracting the Text from a PDF File". This code simply picks the pdf file from the local device using 'file_picker' library of flutter. saves its path to a variable. Then we extract the text of pdf using 'syncfusion_flutter_pdf' library. We simply give the path of the file to the function(with implementation of syncfusion_flutter_pdf), and it returns the text in a String variable. Then you can use this text according to you needs.
